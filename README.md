# Manufacturing_Juggernaut
This is a data-science project to analyze the growth of China's manufacturing sector over the past 40 years, and the country's attempt at graduating to advanced manufacturing (including the application of artificial intelligence, IoT, and 5G wireless network). 

1. China's rise over the past 40 years as a manufacturing powerhouse ("the world's factory floor") was mostly in such low-cost, labor-intensive sectors as textile, apparel, footwear, and toys.   

2. To "visualize" this growth based on actual data, my first round of searching for the relevant datasets, by Googling and talking to academic and industry contacts, turned up mostly macro-economic data, such as the monthly aggragate production level of Chemical Fibre Pulp, a good proxy for the country's total textile output:

Other macro-economic datasets:

3. But the above datasets appear small for this exercise.  What could be good data sources, in the public domain, that can provide more insight?
