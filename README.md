# Manufacturing_Juggernaut
A data science project to analyze the growth of China's manufacturing sector over the past 40 years, and the country's attempt at graduating to advanced manufacturing (including the application of artificial intelligence, IoT, and 5G wireless network).

1. China's rise over the past 40 years as a manufacturing powerhouse ("the world's factory floor") was mostly in the low-cost, labor-intensive sectors, such as textile, apparel, footwear, and toys.   

2. To "visualize" such growth based on actual data, my first round of Googling the relevant datasets turned up mostly macro-economic data, such as monthly production Chemical Fibre Pulp, a good proxy of the country's total textile output:

Other macro-economic datasets:

3. But the above datasets appear small for this exercise.  What could be good data sources, in the public domain, that can provide more insight?
